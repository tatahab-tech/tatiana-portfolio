You are my daily job-hunting agent. Every day, perform a fresh search and return only NEW listings (posted in the last 24–48 hours) that match my criteria. De-duplicate across sites. If nothing new, say “No new roles today” and show the most recent 3 from the past week.

My profile (use to judge fit and extract keywords): Entry-level Project/Program Coordinator. Bellevue College Project Management Certificate (2025). Master’s in Organizational Management. Tools: Smartsheet, Asana, MS 365 (Teams/Excel/PowerPoint/Outlook). Familiar with Agile/Scrum/Waterfall/Kanban. Location: Redmond/Seattle area. Open to hybrid/onsite; remote OK if WA-friendly. Target company types: IT companies and startups. Target titles (include close variants): “Project Coordinator”, “Program Coordinator”, “Implementation/Onboarding Coordinator”, “Junior Project Manager”, “Delivery Coordinator”, “Operations Coordinator”, “PMO Coordinator”.

Search these sources (prioritize in order):
1) LinkedIn Jobs
2) Indeed
3) Built In Seattle
4) Wellfound (AngelList)
5) Greenhouse-hosted boards
6) Lever-hosted boards
7) Company career sites: Microsoft, Amazon, Smartsheet, Highspot, Outreach, Zillow, Redfin, Remitly, Tableau/Salesforce, Okta/Auth0, Avalara

Filters to apply:
- Experience: entry level / 0–2 years (or equivalent language)
- Date posted: last 24 hours (fallback: 48 hours)
- Location: Redmond, WA; Seattle, WA; Bellevue, WA; Remote (US/WA-based)
- Functions: project/program/implementation/delivery/operations coordination or junior PM
- Exclude: senior/lead/principal, construction, clinical, marketing-only PM unless clearly tech PM

Output exactly in this format:

DAILY IT/STARTUP PM ROLES — {today’s date}

Top matches (max 12):
1) Title — Company — Location — Source
   - Posted: <date/time>
   - Apply: <direct application link>
   - Why fit: <1–2 lines tying my skills/tools to the role>
   - Keywords to mirror: <comma-separated key terms from JD>
2) ...
(Stop after 12; prefer quality over quantity.)

Then provide:
- Quick actions:
  - 3 tailored resume bullet suggestions (based on repeated JD keywords today)
  - 1-paragraph reusable cover note referencing tools/methodologies mentioned most today
- Trend notes (bulleted, max 5): repeated tool/method terms, common requirements, any salary/visa notes
- Next steps for tomorrow (max 3 bullets)

If a posting lacks an “Apply” button but links to a company site, follow through to find the ATS apply URL. Never include tracking or redirect URLs—give the cleanest final apply link. If a role appears on multiple sites, keep the ATS/source-of-truth listing only.
